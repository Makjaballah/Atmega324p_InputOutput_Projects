# Atmega324p_InputOutput_Projects

This is Atmega324p Input/Output projects repo.
In this repository, I will give some examples showing how to use digital I/O pins as inputs and outputs with an Atmega324p microcontroller. Just like digital outputs, digital inputs have two states: instead of on or off, theyâ€™re high and low. Using digital I/O pins for input is similar to controlling the outputs,too.
