# Project: Four LEDs toggling using four push-buttons with the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
In this project, I used four push-buttons connected to lower nibble of PORTB (PINB0 to PINB3) of Atmega324p as inputs. The output is connected to lower nibble of PORTD (PIND0 to PIND3) via LEDs. The aim of this project is to show how the state of the four push-buttons can be read in a program.
