# Project: 4-bit up-down counter using the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
The aim of this project is to control a simple 4-bit up-down counter, capable of counting from 0 to F, using the Atmega324p microcontroller. At each step the count should be displayed in hexadecimal on the seven-segment LED display. You will control the counter using a DIP switch which is also interfaced to the Atmega324p microcontroller.
