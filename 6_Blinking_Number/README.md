# Project: Blinking Number with the Atmega324p Microcontroller

## The aim
In this project, 8 LEDs are connected to GPIO ports PB0 to PB7 of the Atmega324p microcontroller. The program counts up from 0 to 255 continuously and turns ON/OFF the appropriate LEDs to show the count. A 500 ms delay is inserted between each count.

## Simulation of the Blinking Number project using Proteus Simulation Software
